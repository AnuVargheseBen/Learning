git commit -m "first commit"
# You just created a Git commit and included a message that says first commit. 
# You must always write a message in commit; it not only helps you identify a commit,
#  but it also enables you to understand what you did with the file at that point. 
#  So tomorrow, if you add a new piece of code in your file, you can write a commit message that says, Added new code, and when you come back in a month to look at your commit history or Git log (the list of commits), 
# you will know what you changed in the files.
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo.git
# connect your computer to GitHub
git push -u origin master
# To push files to my repository
git checkout -b <my branch name>
# create a new branch.It will be the current branch
git checkout master
# to move to master branch

# After commit need to type git push to see the changes
